# Requirements Tracking Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to track and update requirements as they are implemented during the FishMinder MVP development.

## Three-Layer Tracking System

### 1. Task Management System
- High-level phases and detailed subtasks
- Real-time progress tracking with states
- Dependencies and workflow management

### 2. REQUIREMENTS.md File
- Detailed functional and technical requirements
- Checkbox format for completion tracking
- Direct mapping to user needs and acceptance criteria

### 3. MVP.md Progress Dashboard
- Overall project progress visualization
- Phase completion status
- Risk assessment and mitigation tracking

## Requirement Update Workflow

### When Starting a New Feature
1. **Update Task Status**
   ```
   update_tasks({
     "tasks": [
       {"task_id": "current-task-id", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
     ]
   })
   ```

2. **Identify Related Requirements**
   - Find corresponding lines in REQUIREMENTS.md
   - Note the line numbers for tracking
   - Understand acceptance criteria

### When Completing a Feature
1. **Mark Requirements Complete**
   - Edit REQUIREMENTS.md
   - Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
   - Use str-replace-editor tool for updates

2. **Update Task Status**
   ```
   update_tasks({
     "tasks": [
       {"task_id": "completed-task-id", "state": "COMPLETE"},
       {"task_id": "next-task-id", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
     ]
   })
   ```

3. **Update MVP.md Progress**
   - Update phase completion percentages
   - Mark subtasks as complete
   - Update overall progress dashboard

## Progress Calculation Formulas

### Overall MVP Progress
```
MVP Progress = (Completed Major Phases / Total Major Phases) * 100
Currently: (0 / 13) * 100 = 0%
```

### Requirements Completion
```
Requirements Progress = (Completed Checkboxes / Total Checkboxes) * 100
Total Checkboxes in REQUIREMENTS.md: 78
Currently: (0 / 78) * 100 = 0%
```

### Phase Completion
```
Phase Progress = (Completed Subtasks / Total Subtasks) * 100
Example Phase 1: (0 / 3) * 100 = 0%
```

## Update Examples

### Example 1: Completing Angler Management
```bash
# 1. Update REQUIREMENTS.md
str-replace-editor:
  - Line 9: "- [ ] Support multiple anglers" ‚Üí "- [x] Support multiple anglers"
  - Line 10: "- [ ] Add/remove anglers" ‚Üí "- [x] Add/remove anglers"
  - Line 11: "- [ ] Assign unique identifiers" ‚Üí "- [x] Assign unique identifiers"
  - Line 12: "- [ ] Display active angler list" ‚Üí "- [x] Display active angler list"

# 2. Update Task System
update_tasks({
  "tasks": [
    {"task_id": "j1cvkEYn9NvsBQJ7RZDNuU", "state": "COMPLETE"},
    {"task_id": "8jDqTKs7D9B7Nq1NSEnpXJ", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
  ]
})

# 3. Update MVP.md
str-replace-editor:
  - Phase 4 status: "‚è≥ Pending" ‚Üí "‚úÖ Complete"
  - Overall progress: "0%" ‚Üí "8%" (1/13 phases)
  - Requirements progress: "0%" ‚Üí "5%" (4/78 requirements)
```

### Example 2: Completing Project Setup
```bash
# 1. Update REQUIREMENTS.md
str-replace-editor:
  - Line 49: "- [ ] Built using Blazor framework" ‚Üí "- [x] Built using Blazor framework"
  - Line 50: "- [ ] Component-based architecture" ‚Üí "- [x] Component-based architecture"
  - Line 56: "- [ ] PWA manifest file configuration" ‚Üí "- [x] PWA manifest file configuration"

# 2. Update Task System
update_tasks({
  "tasks": [
    {"task_id": "mt5g29dqjwi7k1VLiTUe12", "state": "COMPLETE"},
    {"task_id": "qhNF22h2aKW9WTuNnTzrnZ", "state": "IN_PROGRESS"}
  ]
})

# 3. Update MVP.md
str-replace-editor:
  - Phase 1 status: "üîÑ In Progress" ‚Üí "‚úÖ Complete"
  - Current phase: "Phase 1" ‚Üí "Phase 2"
  - Phase completion: "(0/3 subtasks)" ‚Üí "(3/3 subtasks)"
```

## Quality Gates

### Before Marking Requirements Complete
- [ ] Feature is fully implemented
- [ ] Unit tests are written and passing
- [ ] Feature works in offline mode
- [ ] Mobile optimization is applied
- [ ] User acceptance criteria are met

### Before Marking Phase Complete
- [ ] All subtasks are complete
- [ ] All related requirements are marked complete
- [ ] Integration testing is successful
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code review is completed

### Before Marking MVP Complete
- [ ] All 13 phases are complete
- [ ] All 78 requirements are marked complete
- [ ] End-to-end testing is successful
- [ ] Performance targets are met
- [ ] User documentation is complete

## Troubleshooting

### If Requirements Don't Match Implementation
1. Review the requirement for clarity
2. Adjust implementation to meet requirement
3. If requirement needs modification, document the change
4. Update acceptance criteria accordingly

### If Progress Tracking Gets Out of Sync
1. Review all three tracking systems
2. Identify discrepancies
3. Update the most authoritative source (usually REQUIREMENTS.md)
4. Sync other tracking systems to match

### If Scope Creep Occurs
1. Document new requirements
2. Assess impact on MVP timeline
3. Consider deferring to post-MVP
4. Update tracking systems if scope changes are approved

Remember: The goal is accurate progress tracking that reflects real completion status and helps maintain project momentum.
